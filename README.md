# To install:
Utilize the same python environment as SiliconCompiler.

    git clone https://github.com/siliconcompiler/scgallery.git
    cd scgallery
    python3 -m pip install .

# To run a design:

    sc-gallery -design sha512  # Will run on all supported targets
    sc-gallery -design sha512 -target asap7_demo  # Will only run on asap7
    sc-gallery -target asap7_demo  # Will run all designs supported on asap7
    sc-gallery  # Will run all designs on all targets

# Extending with proprietary design and technologies:

    sc-gallery -gallery private.gallery -design aes  # Will run on all supported targets in your private gallery
    sc-gallery -gallery private.gallery  # Will run all designs on all targets in your private gallery

# To check, create, and update rules:

    python3 -m scgallery.rules -cfg <cfg> -rules <rules> -check  # Check if run met the rule requirements.
    python3 -m scgallery.rules -cfg <cfg> -rules <rules> -create  # Create an initial set of rules.
    python3 -m scgallery.rules -cfg <cfg> -rules <rules> -update_all  # Update rules based on the run.
    python3 -m scgallery.rules -cfg <cfg> -rules <rules> -tighten_passing  # Update passing rules based on the run.
